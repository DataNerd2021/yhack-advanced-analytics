I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said \"I got bored with the game\".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  \\n\\nI teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.\\n\\nI met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in \\'90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.\\n\\nI also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and \"The Play\" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.\\n\\nMy own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I\\'d plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.\\n\\nOur team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many \"crazy\" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.\\n\\nEven in my early 60\\'s now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.\\n\\nOn my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. üòÇ', 'You know it‚Äôs a good game when there‚Äôs 20 minute highlights', 'Saint Max on his day can break down any press man.

If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\\nStep 5. There should be no problems here.\\nStep 6.

All the veterans I saw said that this battle was a real hell.  when the asphalt is repaired or the pipeline is replaced, the remains of soldiers are still found in the ground, and 70 years have passed...', 'The Germans really did hand the Soviets a beachhead fortress in this city. With all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into.', \"A couple of my distant German family members were at Stalingrad, and are still there as far as I know. None of the family know when or where they died exactly, but there are Oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial. I only learnt this while looking through family history, trying to learn more about my roots. They were barely in their 20's, conscripted and sent to fight. I'm now older than they were, and I couldn't imagine going through that sort of living hell. I understand they were on the 'wrong' side, and I absolutely respect the Russians for defending their homeland, but whenever I hear the word Stalingrad, it makes me think of those guys. War is a waste, so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power.\", 'Thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the 227 order. So many people think it was just a cruel note, allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim.\\nBut please, do stop addressing Soviets as \"Russians\". There were soldiers of many nations in the Red Army, and they do not deserve to be forgotten.', \"My grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle, then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner, finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution. He never wanted to talk much about the war, only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival, I guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world. I remember the day I asked him about it, he didn't say anything, my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a Stalingrad.\", \"Any entertainment channel you watch will never tell you any of the real bad stuff they are doing. They will give you some small nuggets of truth but never tell you what's really going on\", 'The information we get through public domain is channelized and censored so that people should never know about them.  It is just laughable to allow a tv show to sell all your secrets so whatever they share you cannot really tell whether it is the whole truth or just an explanation to keep you away from too much of thinking. \\nI appreciate the concept of the show and it is binge worthy that is for sure but it cannot be honest.', \"I remember reading an article about   an apartment building that kept making people sick and they suspected mold but couldn't find any, it turned out that the air conditioning ducts were making a high pitch frequency sound that was making people sick.\", \"I guess I'm a true conspiracy theorist, because I don't think anyone that would actually know if any of these things existed would tell the truth, and those that don't know for sure are only expressing an opinion.\", \"We live in Northern California. Took a ride through the destruction.\\nNo doubt about it, I've seen what napalm can do. And it burns at 2,000¬∞, where aluminum melts. There were many trees standing in untouched by the flames. And right next to it was a vehicle whose aluminum wheels melted down the driveway. Yeah right, no doubt about it.\"]\n"
