If the side colors of the cross or first layer don\\'t line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don\\'t just pick white pieces randomly.

At 5:33 I say \"you should already know how to do this\". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.\\n\\n*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*\\nStep 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\\nStep 5. There should be no problems here.\\nStep 6.

Turn the bottom (don\\'t rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\\n\\n\"Why do I need to reassemble the cube?\"\\nRandomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable.

Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment.
