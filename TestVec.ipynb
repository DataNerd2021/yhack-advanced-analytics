The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed.

That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.\\n\\nNow the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff.

As seen previously in the \"Missing Persons\" and  \"Autopsy Report\" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the \"Informational\" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn\\'t teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the \"Presentation\" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane\\'s secret video of \"9780415263573\", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn\\'t able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it\\'s mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out \"Help\" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the \"original found footage\" video and later the \"Pitfalls\" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it\\'s last victims and in this case, even it\\'s originator which is the driver). It\\'s all just a theory which I just came up with. Don\\'t take it canon lol.', 'Imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the Backrooms.', \"Fun fact: The reason why the F-35 fighter that Maverick mentions when he's briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the GPS jamming.\\n\\nIn actuality behind the scenes, the F-35 didn't have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the F-18s. They needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the F-35 couldn't accommodate that\", \"Poor Viserys.

The “Heir For A Day” brothel scene really makes me question him. We saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all, despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the Gold Cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys. Mysaria seems to be an enabling force, goading him into his darker tendencies. When he says “we must all grieve in our own ways”, I think he actually was somewhat saddened by Baelon’s and Aemma’s death. Daemon does want power, but he does love his brother.\\n\\n“Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.” - Archmaester Gyldayn', 'That childbirth scene was gruesome. The screams affected me just as much as Shireen’s burning at the stake.😫', \"Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it. This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all.\", 'My underestanding is that the wife wasn\\'t going to survive either way. So it was a matter of \"letting the gods take them both\" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We\\'ve seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay\\'s scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.\\n\\nAlso, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he\\'ll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn\\'t wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.\\n\\nI\\'m really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven\\'t seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei\\'s chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys\\'s racial \"change\" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some \"OMG WOKE\" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn\\'t bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he\\'s up there with Davos.\\n\\n Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.\\n\\nAnd then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I\\'m glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was \"There\\'s never been a queen\" but one of the others was quick to chime in with \"Only out of precedent and tradition\". It\\'s nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has \"hah, but she\\'s a WOMAN!\" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.\\n\\nAlso while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don\\'t like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.\\n\\nMost of all, the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones.', \"1:37 I'm Turkish but the man speaks so fast that I couldn't understand my native language 😅\", 'Zaten bir-iki istisna dışında futbolumuz komikten öteye geçemedi 😴😴😴', 'watching Doflamingo’s speech after Reverie is even CRAZIER 😭😭😭', \"It's worth noting that Law's plan was to destroy the SMILE factory to get Kaido mad at Doflamingo so Doflamingo and Kaido would end up fighting each other.

But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.\\n\\nViserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne.

Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV.

I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn\\'t prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  \\n\\nThings have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of \"No Child Left Behind\" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn\\'t graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  \\n\\nToo much government involvement means teachers aren\\'t allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren\\'t just expected to educate students.

It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.

I\\'ve also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.\\n\\nThe first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there\\'s no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. \\n\\nThe second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn\\'t be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that\\'s their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.\\n\\nThe third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population\\'s education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you\\'ve been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).\\n\\nThe fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It\\'s up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the \"decision makers\" (sales people) set for the parents.\\n\\nThe final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what \"national curriculum\" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the \"national curriculum\". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I\\'ve been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they\\'re sales people at best.\\nI should also mention that many parents have no clue about education, yet influence the schools with their misconceptions...but this is not the parents\\' fault. Rather, it\\'s the school\\'s fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program.\\n\\nAs for price... it\\'s simply about demand vs supply.  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before, combined with a desperate middle class (and higher) trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost. They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler.\\n\\nUnfortunately I exited the market, partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problems...mostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum.', \"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.\\nI would also point out that every doctor in the world (with common sense) would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue.\\nIt's funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stress-free education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months.\\nI wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries.

You perfectly described a person's first experiences with game dev and Unity pretty well. Most people's are worse than your experience because they have no programming experience and dont understand anything going on at all 😄\", 'You got me in the first minute “not seeing friends I don’t have”. And “looking at unity, no idea what I was looking at” \\nExactly my feeling!', 'damn you were one hell of a 14 year old developer', 'yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.\\n\\nFirst off, to game devs who are just starting out: don\\'t attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won\\'t work out well. And I\\'m not saying this because I think I\\'m smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I\\'m pretty average and tons of people could\\'ve done a lot better in my shoes. But that\\'s just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I\\'d been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I\\'ve seen too many comments in the vein of \"wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this\" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don\\'t want to discourage anyone who doesn\\'t realize this. \\n\\nSo I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn\\'t really matter as long as you\\'re able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print \"hello world\", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn\\'t really matter how quickly you\\'re able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you\\'re doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.\\n\\nAnd on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn\\'t lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn\\'t on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I\\'m actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.\\n\\nAnd last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break? I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500,000 views, and this is definitely not one of them. so if you\\'re watching this, go watch someone else\\'s video or something, this one has way too many views already.', 'This video taught me to spend way too much time on ragdolls when making a 3D game', \"Hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesn't work out great. also good video!\", 'Microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo. Everything is quickly becoming a subscription.', \"The reason triple AAA games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design. They're treating what were supposed to be  enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly.

Business just won't allow that much money to be spent on an experiment. Everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey, uncreative, bland games that look really nice.\", \"I've been telling my friends this for the past couple years.
